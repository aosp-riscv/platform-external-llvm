/// This represents a single basic block in LLVM. A basic block is simply a
/// container of instructions that execute sequentially. Basic blocks are Values
/// because they are referenced by instructions such as branches and switch
/// tables. The type of a BasicBlock is "Type::LabelTy" because the basic block
/// represents a label to which a branch can jump.
///
/// A well formed basic block is formed of a list of non-terminating 
/// instructions followed by a single TerminatorInst instruction.  
/// TerminatorInst's may not occur in the middle of basic blocks, and must 
/// terminate the blocks. The BasicBlock class allows malformed basic blocks to
/// occur because it may be useful in the intermediate stage of constructing or
/// modifying a program. However, the verifier will ensure that basic blocks
/// are "well formed".
